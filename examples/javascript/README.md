# Example Javascript Addon

Very simple static WATCHED javascript addon.

However, it is recommended to use the typescript example as a starting point, to benefit from the autocomplete features.

## Start the server

```shell
cd examples/javascript
# Install dependencies
npm i
# Start in development mode
npm run develop
# Start in production mode
npm run start
```
