# WATCHED.com Javascript SDK

With the WATCHED.com SDK you easily can create your own addons.

There is also a SDK available for [python](https://github.com/watchedcom/schema).

## Jumpstart

The most easy way to start is to edit our example addon.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/watchedcom/example-js
cd example-js
npm install
npm run debug
```

Please don't forget to change the `name` and `id` in `package.json` and `src/index.js`.

## Connect to your delevopment machine

1. Find the local IP address of your computer (this is usually something like `192.168.0.123`).
2. Open the WATCHED app on your phone or TV, and navigate to the add screen.
3. Enter your IP address and click on `Continue`.
4. Now you should see all your addons.
